# React Frontend — Getting Started Guide

This project was bootstrapped using **Create React App (CRA)**.
It provides a pre-configured React environment for fast development, testing, and production builds.

---

#  Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

* Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
* npm or yarn package manager

Check installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

#  Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

---

##  Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the application in **development mode**.

* Opens automatically at:
  http://localhost:3000
* The app reloads automatically when you make changes.
* Any lint or compile errors appear in the console.

---

##  Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in **interactive watch mode**.

Use this command to:

* Execute unit tests
* Continuously monitor changes during development

---

##  Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates an optimized **production build** in the `build/` folder.

Key features:

* Bundles React in production mode
* Optimizes performance and file size
* Generates hashed filenames for caching
* Ready for deployment

---

##  Eject Configuration (Advanced)

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Important:** This action is **irreversible**.

Ejecting will:

* Remove the single CRA dependency
* Copy configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project
* Provide full control over build configuration

This step is recommended **only for advanced customization**.
