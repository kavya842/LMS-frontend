This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) designed to manage user registrations and learning-related functionalities with a clear separation between frontend and backend. The application focuses on providing a structured and user-friendly interface along with a backend that handles data storage and user management.
The frontend is responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user interactions, while the backend manages database operations such as user registration, authentication, and storing test user data. The project follows a modular structure, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale.
This LMS project demonstrates practical knowledge of full-stack development concepts, including frontend–backend integration, database connectivity, and clean project organization.
