# .gitignore — React Project

This `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary, sensitive, and auto-generated files are not committed to the repository.

---

## Dependencies

The `node_modules` folder contains installed packages and should not be committed because it can be regenerated using `npm install`.

```
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js
```

---

## Testing

Coverage reports generated during testing should not be tracked.

```
/coverage
```

---

## Production Build

The `build` folder contains compiled production assets that can be recreated during deployment.

```
/build
```

---

## Environment Files

Environment configuration files may contain sensitive information such as API keys and secrets. These must never be committed.

```
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
```

---

## System Files

Operating system files that are automatically generated and not relevant to the project.

```
.DS_Store
```

---

## Log Files

Debug and error logs generated by npm and yarn.

```
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
```

---

## Summary

This configuration keeps the repository clean by excluding:

* Installed dependencies
* Build artifacts
* Environment variables
* Test coverage reports
* System and log files
